The theme was exploring new places and I decided to explore the state of California, specifically the Los Angeles area. These locations were chosen based on the amazing experience I had when I last visited. All locations were tourist attractions, therefore its perfect to visit during summer vacation. California has a lot of beautiful spots and they should all be explored responsibly.
