  Using InDesign I created this short magazine for my Media Design course. I
  take credit for all images used, its all my original content. Everything I
  state in this magazine is true to my knowledge. Overall, this project took
  about 3 weeks and a half to complete.

The theme was exploring new places and I decided to explore the state of California, specifically the Los Angeles area. These locations were chosen based on the amazing experience I had when I last visited. All locations were tourist attractions, therefore its perfect to visit during summer vacation. California has a lot of beautiful spots and they should all be explored responsibly.
