  Using a Bootstrap template, I created a wesite for a fake application. The
  idea was created as a group for my Web Design & Publishing course, but this
  was my execution of our application. This is a fake application created for a
  college course.

Our intended audience was students who commute to Texas State University. Parking has always been an issue on campus and our application was created to solve that problem. Through Figma I created every display screen for this application. Texas State Park-N-Go is a free app to anybody who attends Texas State University. Its very easy to use and its **free**! If you're someone who's constantly worried about finding parking, then this is for you! We've got you covered and you'll never be late again. Overall, this project took about a month and a half to complete.
